# LTI Base Boilerplate
A base package for LTI tools built on edX, simple to write and deploy.  

# Installation 

1. Open terminal to the project directory
2. Run the following command - 
> npm run start

3. wait until npm installs all the packages and starts grunt
4. Run the following command - 
> touch config.php

copy the config code below into the new created config.php file

```php
<?php
	//Configuration File
	//key=>secret
	$config = array(
		'lti_keys'=>array(
			'YOUR_CLIENT_KEY'=>'YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET'
		),
		'use_db'=>true,
		'db'=>array(
			'driver'=>'mysql',
			'hostname'=>'localhost',
			'username'=>'YOUR_DB_USERNAME',
			'password'=>'YOUR_DB_PASSWORD',
			'dbname'=>'YOUR_DB_NAME',
		)
	);
?>
```

4. Open localhost/path/to/directory/ in your browser, you should now see the main page. If there is no color or styling, then you may need to quit the grunt tasks running and type "Grunt run" into your terminal again to restart.


# Setup
1. Edit config.php with your respective LTI keys and optional database details
2. Host on a https server (LTI with edX requires HTTPS)
3. Add the respective keys in the edX advanced settings
4. Create a new LTI component and point it to the correct URL

# Usage
1. use test.php with LTI to confirm that everything is connecting
2. on each page, include <?php require_once('inc/header.php'); ?> at the top
3. to ensure valid LTI, make sure to run $lti->requirevalid(); directly after header.php

# Testing
For testing we recommend the LTI 1.1 testbed, available at: http://www.imsglobal.org/developers/LTI/test/v1p1/lms.php
